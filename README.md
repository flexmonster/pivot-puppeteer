## Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts

Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts is a powerful and fully customizable JavaScript component for web reporting. It is packed with all core features for data analysis and can easily become a part of your data visualization project. The tool supports popular frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Blazor, and [more](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/available-tutorials-integration?r=github). Also, Flexmonster connects to [any data source](https://www.flexmonster.com/doc/supported-data-sources?r=github), including SQL and NoSQL databases, JSON and CSV files, OLAP cubes, and Elasticsearch.

This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to export Flexmonster reports without using a browser. We achieve this using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).
